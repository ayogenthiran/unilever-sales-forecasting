## üöÄ Usage

1. Open `sales-prediction-assignment-anojan.ipynb`
2. Execute all cells sequentially
3. Predictions saved to `predictions_2022-46_to_2023-02_optimized.csv`

## üìà Performance

### Validation Methodology

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Model Architecture Decisions
- **Tweedie Objective**: Chosen over custom WMAPE objectives for stability and convergence
- **External Metrics**: WMAPE, Accuracy, and Bias computed post-training as per assignment requirements
- **Two-Stage Design**: Explicitly handles zero-inflation (56.2% zero sales) through classification + regression
- **Ensemble Approach**: Combines multiple models to reduce variance and improve robustness

### Why Tweedie Over Custom WMAPE?
- **Stability**: Tweedie loss is smooth and well-behaved for optimization
- **Zero-inflation**: Naturally handles zero-heavy, right-skewed distributions
- **Convergence**: More reliable training compared to non-smooth WMAPE objectives
- **Assignment Compliance**: External WMAPE evaluation meets all requirements
